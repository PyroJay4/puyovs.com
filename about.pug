        Hello, I'm the creator of Puyo Puyo VS (PPVS). I created PPVS because I wanted people to play Puyo Puyo the way it's intended to be: together. 
        Somehow Sega screwed it up completely. After Puyo Pop Fever, no version of Puyo Puyo has seen a release in the west. (Also, check out our 
        <a href="http://www.puyonexus.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=41">translation patches</a>). Not even the PC version of Puyo Pop Fever made it outside 
        Japan, the only version of the game that has an online mode. With PPVS I hope to create an easy way for everyone to enjoy a game of Puyo Puyo 
        without the hassle of importing games/not understanding Japanese/illegal methods to obtain the games from Sega.
